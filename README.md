My Solutions For Kattis Problems that I have solved successfully. I have created all of the code myself.

I'm currently in Computing Science at the University of FSDM.

These are usually not the most optimal solutions, but they all are accepted within the given time limit.

My Kattis account is J-Mourad.

Feel free to look at these solutions for assistance on a problem, but please don't just copy my solutions, because there is no point in doing so.
